# WORK IN PROGRESS

This example demonstrates how to map node and relationships to Ruby classes.

## How to install

`bundle install`

## How to run

`NEO4J_USERNAME=username NEO4J_PASSWORD=password bundle exec rackup config.ru`

or 'NEO4J_USERNAME=username NEO4J_PASSWORD=password bundle exec shotgun config.ru'


## Design

This example is very slow if used from the Neo4j Server since it does a lot of requests instead of using just one cypher query (as in the neo4j-core example).
Notice that Neo4j.rb tries to hide the internal Neo4j ids. Instead in the example we have created primary keys on title and name properties.
